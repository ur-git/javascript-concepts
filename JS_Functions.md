# JavaScript: First-Class Functions and Higher-Order Functions

## First-Class Functions

### Definition
JavaScript has **first-class functions**, meaning that functions are treated as **first-class citizens**. This is a fundamental property of the language.

### Key Characteristics
1. **Functions are values**:
   - Functions can be treated like any other value (e.g., numbers, strings).
   - Functions can be stored in variables or object properties.

2. **Functions as objects**:
   - Functions are a special type of object in JavaScript.
   - Since objects are values, functions are values too.

### Practical Examples
- **Storing Functions**:
  ```javascript
  // Function expression stored in a variable
  const greet = function () {
    console.log('Hello!');
  };

  // Function stored as an object method
  const obj = {
    sayHi: function () {
      console.log('Hi!');
    }
  };
  ```

- **Passing Functions as Arguments**:
  ```javascript
  // addEventListener is a higher-order function
  document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', greet);
  ```
  Here, the `greet` function is passed as a value (callback) to `addEventListener`.

- **Returning Functions from Functions**:
  ```javascript
  function createMultiplier(multiplier) {
    return function (value) {
      return value * multiplier;
    };
  }

  const double = createMultiplier(2);
  console.log(double(5)); // 10
  ```

### Function Methods
Since functions are objects, they can have methods, just like arrays or other objects. One such method is `bind`, which we will explore further later.

## Higher-Order Functions

### Definition
A **higher-order function** is a function that:
1. Receives another function as an argument, or
2. Returns a new function.

### Examples
1. **Receiving a Function as an Argument**:
   ```javascript
   // addEventListener is a higher-order function
   document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', greet);
   ```
   - `addEventListener` receives the `greet` function as a callback.
   - A callback function is executed later by the higher-order function.

2. **Returning a Function**:
   ```javascript
   function greetCreator(name) {
     return function () {
       console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
     };
   }

   const greetJohn = greetCreator('John');
   greetJohn(); // Hello, John!
   ```

### Importance
Higher-order functions are made possible because JavaScript supports first-class functions. They are widely used in functional programming and are powerful tools for abstraction.

## First-Class Functions vs. Higher-Order Functions

- **First-Class Functions**:
  - A **feature** of the JavaScript language.
  - Means functions are treated as values.
  - Does not refer to any specific function in practice.

- **Higher-Order Functions**:
  - Actual functions in practice.
  - Either receive or return other functions.

**Key Distinction**: First-class functions are a **concept**, while higher-order functions are a **practical application** of that concept.

---

## Summary
- JavaScript's first-class functions enable powerful programming paradigms, such as higher-order functions.
- Higher-order functions allow us to:
  - Pass functions as arguments.
  - Return functions from functions.
- Understanding the distinction between first-class and higher-order functions is essential for mastering JavaScript.

In the next lecture, we will explore creating our own higher-order functions in more detail.

# More About Higher-Order Functions in JavaScript

## Creating a Higher-Order Function

To understand how higher-order functions work, letâ€™s create one step by step.

### Step 1: Writing Generic Functions
First, we define two basic string transformation functions:

```javascript
// Function to remove all spaces and convert to lowercase
const oneWord = function (str) {
  return str.replace(/\s/g, '').toLowerCase();
};

// Function to capitalize the first word of a string
const upperFirstWord = function (str) {
  const [first, ...others] = str.split(' ');
  return [first.toUpperCase(), ...others].join(' ');
};
```

These functions operate independently, performing specific transformations:
- `oneWord`: Removes spaces and converts the string to lowercase.
- `upperFirstWord`: Capitalizes only the first word of the string.

---

### Step 2: Defining the Higher-Order Function

Now, we create the higher-order function `transformer`, which:
- Accepts a string.
- Accepts a function as its second argument (a callback function).

```javascript
const transformer = function (str, fn) {
  console.log(`Original string: ${str}`);
  console.log(`Transformed string: ${fn(str)}`);
  console.log(`Transformed by: ${fn.name}`);
};
```

#### Explanation:
1. `str`: The string to transform.
2. `fn`: The callback function to apply.
3. Outputs the original string, transformed string, and the name of the transformation function (using the `name` property of the function).

---

### Step 3: Using the Higher-Order Function

```javascript
transformer('JavaScript is the best!', upperFirstWord);
// Output:
// Original string: JavaScript is the best!
// Transformed string: JAVASCRIPT is the best!
// Transformed by: upperFirstWord

transformer('JavaScript is the best!', oneWord);
// Output:
// Original string: JavaScript is the best!
// Transformed string: javascriptisthebest!
// Transformed by: oneWord
```

- The `transformer` function applies the passed callback to the string and logs relevant information.
- Callback functions (`upperFirstWord`, `oneWord`) handle the transformation logic.

---

## Example: Built-In Higher-Order Functions

### Event Listeners as Higher-Order Functions

Event listeners in JavaScript use the concept of higher-order functions. For example:

```javascript
const highFive = () => console.log('ðŸ‘‹');

document.body.addEventListener('click', highFive);
```

#### Explanation:
- `addEventListener` is a higher-order function that takes an event type (e.g., `click`) and a callback function (`highFive`).
- The callback executes when the event occurs.

### Array Methods Using Callbacks

The `forEach` method demonstrates the same principle:

```javascript
['Jonas', 'Martha', 'Adam'].forEach(highFive);
// Output:
// ðŸ‘‹
// ðŸ‘‹
// ðŸ‘‹
```

- The `forEach` method is a higher-order function that takes a callback function (`highFive`) and executes it for each array element.

---

## Why Use Higher-Order Functions?

### Benefits:
1. **Code Reusability**: Break down functionality into reusable, modular pieces.
2. **Abstraction**: Hide low-level implementation details and work at a higher conceptual level.

For example:
- The `transformer` function abstracts away string transformation details, delegating the implementation to the callback functions (`oneWord` or `upperFirstWord`).
- This makes `transformer` a reusable function that focuses only on applying a transformation, without being concerned about how the transformation happens.

---

## Functions Returning Functions

Higher-order functions can also return new functions. Hereâ€™s an example:

```javascript
const greet = function (greeting) {
  return function (name) {
    console.log(`${greeting}, ${name}`);
  };
};

// Usage
const greeterHey = greet('Hey');

greeterHey('Jonas'); // Output: Hey, Jonas

greeterHey('Steven'); // Output: Hey, Steven

// Or directly:
greet('Hello')('Jonas'); // Output: Hello, Jonas
```

### Arrow Function Version

The `greet` function can be rewritten using arrow functions:

```javascript
const greet = (greeting) => (name) => console.log(`${greeting}, ${name}`);

// Usage
const greeterHi = greet('Hi');

greeterHi('Alice'); // Output: Hi, Alice
```

---

## Callback Functions in Real-World JavaScript

### Why Are Callbacks Used?
1. **Reusable Code**: Separate logic into smaller, reusable pieces.
2. **Dynamic Behavior**: Functions like `addEventListener` or `forEach` use callbacks to dynamically determine behavior.

### Abstraction
Callbacks create levels of abstraction. For example:
- `transformer` focuses on transforming a string but delegates the actual transformation logic to specific callback functions like `oneWord` or `upperFirstWord`.
- This separation of concerns makes the code cleaner and easier to maintain.

---

## Key Takeaways
- Higher-order functions are a cornerstone of JavaScript, enabling dynamic and reusable code.
- Callback functions allow abstraction and delegation, simplifying logic.
- Functions returning other functions are a powerful tool, particularly in functional programming.

---

## Challenge
Try creating your own example of a higher-order function or a function returning another function, based on a real-world scenario. Experiment with arrow functions and callbacks to deepen your understanding.
