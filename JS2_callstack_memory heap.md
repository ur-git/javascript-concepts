# JS Engine
JS engine consists of call stack and memory heap

## Call Stack
Call stack is where the JS code is executed using execution context 
Call stack uses STACK data structure
It operates in LIFO Mode

Memory heaps are unstructured memory pool, with no order in sorting data
This is where objects are stored
