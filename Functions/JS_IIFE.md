# Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)

## What is an IIFE?

An **Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)** is a function that is executed immediately after it is defined. This pattern is useful when a function needs to run only once and does not need to persist in the program. It "disappears" after execution, leaving no trace in the global or outer scope.

## Why Use an IIFE?

1. **One-Time Execution**:

   - Useful for initialization code or logic that only needs to run once.

2. **Encapsulation and Privacy**:
   - Creates a private scope to protect variables from being accessed or modified by the global scope or other parts of the program.

## Syntax of an IIFE

### 1. Basic IIFE with Function Expression:

```javascript
(function () {
  console.log("This function runs immediately and only once!");
})();
// Output: "This function runs immediately and only once!"
```

### 2. IIFE with Arrow Function:

```javascript
(() => {
  console.log("This arrow function IIFE executes immediately!");
})();
// Output: "This arrow function IIFE executes immediately!"
```

### 3. Explanation of Parentheses:

- Wrapping the function in parentheses `( ... )` turns it into an **expression** rather than a **declaration**. This allows immediate invocation.
- Without parentheses, JavaScript expects a function declaration, which must have a name and cannot be invoked directly.

```javascript
// Incorrect (throws error):
function() {
    console.log("This will fail");
}();

// Correct:
(function() {
    console.log("This works because it's a function expression.");
})();
```

## Scopes and Data Privacy

### How Scopes Work:

- Functions create **scopes**, encapsulating variables inside them.
- Variables in an inner scope are not accessible from the outer/global scope.

#### Example:

```javascript
(function () {
  const isPrivate = 42;
  console.log(isPrivate); // Output: 42
})();

console.log(isPrivate); // ERROR: isPrivate is not defined
```

- The variable `isPrivate` is encapsulated within the IIFE and cannot be accessed outside its scope.

### ES6 Block Scopes:

- Modern JavaScript introduces block scoping using `let` and `const`, which also provides data encapsulation without the need for a function.

#### Example:

```javascript
{
  const isPrivate = 42;
}
console.log(isPrivate); // ERROR: isPrivate is not defined
```

#### Comparison with `var`:

Variables declared with `var` do not respect block scoping:

```javascript
{
  var notPrivate = 42;
}
console.log(notPrivate); // Output: 42
```

## Modern Relevance of IIFE

- With ES6, block scopes (`{ ... }`) often replace IIFEs for data encapsulation.
- **Still useful for:**
  - Running a function exactly once.
  - Initialization logic.
  - Use cases where immediate execution is required.

## Key Takeaways

1. IIFEs are a pattern, not a feature of JavaScript.
2. They help create private scopes and encapsulate data.
3. With ES6, block scoping often replaces IIFEs for privacy.
4. Use IIFEs when you need to:
   - Execute code immediately.
   - Avoid polluting the global scope.
   - Encapsulate private data.
