### **Difference Between Web Workers and Service Workers**

| Feature              | **Web Workers** üñ•Ô∏è                                                                                                                                        | **Service Workers** üåê                                                                                                                                     |

| **Purpose**          | Used for running JavaScript in a separate thread to improve performance.                                                                                  | Acts as a proxy between the web app and the network to enable caching, push notifications, and offline support.                                            |
| **Thread Type**      | Runs in a separate background thread (worker thread).                                                                                                     | Runs in the background as an event-driven worker.                                                                                                          |
| **Scope**            | Works only for the page that created it.                                                                                                                  | Works independently of the web page, can handle multiple pages.                                                                                            |
| **Lifecycle**        | Exists only while the page is open.                                                                                                                       | Persists even after the page is closed (until terminated by the browser).                                                                                  |
| **Network Requests** | Cannot intercept or modify network requests.                                                                                                              | Can intercept, cache, and modify network requests (acts as a proxy).                                                                                       |
| **Communication**    | Communicates with the main thread using `postMessage()`.                                                                                                  | Listens for events like `fetch` and `push` without direct interaction with the main thread.                                                                |
| **Use Cases**        | - Running CPU-intensive tasks (e.g., complex calculations, image processing). <br> - Keeping the UI responsive by handling heavy computations separately. | - Enabling offline functionality via caching. <br> - Handling background sync and push notifications. <br> - Reducing load time by serving cached content. |
| **Example**          | A web-based video editor that processes video frames in a background thread.                                                                              | A news website that loads previously visited articles even when offline.                                                                                   |

### **Key Takeaways**

- **Web Workers** are useful for running heavy computations without blocking the main UI thread.
- **Service Workers** enhance performance by caching assets and enabling offline capabilities.
