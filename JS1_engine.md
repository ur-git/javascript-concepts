# JavaScript
It is highlevel, object oriented, JIT language.
It is single thread language

# JS Engine
Every browser has its own JS engine , Most popular is Google V8 engine.

## Compiler 
In this , entire code is taken and converted into machine code at once , written in binary file that can be executed by a compiler.

It creates machine code into a portable file which can be executed(CPU processor) anywhere.So, execution can happen way after compilation

It takes time to start, as it goes through entire source code

## Interpreter 
Runs through entire source code and executes it line by line.
That's why the execution is very slow.

## Just-in-time Compilation
Javascript uses a combination of interpreters and compilers. Js is not a interpreted language .

Entire code is converted to machine code at once, and is executed immediately.

In JS, no portable file is created and execution happens immediately
